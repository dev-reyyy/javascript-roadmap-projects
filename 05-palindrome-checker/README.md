# Palindrome Checker

## 📖 Overview

A simple app that checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome. Users can enter text and click the "Check" button to see if it reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.

## 🚀 Features

- Textarea input for user text
- Checks for palindrome on button click
- Ignores spaces, punctuation, and case
- Displays a clear result with visual feedback

## 🛠️ Tech/Concepts Practiced

- DOM selection and manipulation
- Event listeners (`click` event)
- String normalization (lowercasing, removing non-alphanumeric characters)
- Regular expressions for filtering input
- Functions for code organization

## 📚 Learning Notes

- **Challenge:**  
  I forgot the regular expression needed to remove non-alphanumeric characters.
- **Solution:**  
  I looked up the correct regex pattern on the internet.
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Make the palindrome check run automatically as the user types, instead of only when the button is clicked.
