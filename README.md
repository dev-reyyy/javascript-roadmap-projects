# JavaScript Roadmap Projects

This repository contains **50 progressively challenging JavaScript projects**, starting from beginner-friendly DOM manipulation tasks to advanced, framework-prep applications.  

The goal is to strengthen JavaScript fundamentals and build a solid foundation before moving into modern frameworks like **Vue** and **React**.  

---

## ðŸ“š Roadmap Overview

Projects are grouped into 5 stages, from **Beginner â†’ Advanced**:

### Stage 1 â€“ Beginner Basics (1â€“10)
- DOM selection, events, functions, conditionals
- Examples: Hello World Button, Counter App, Palindrome Checker

### Stage 2 â€“ Core DOM Manipulation (11â€“20)
- Event listeners, forms, dynamic UI components
- Examples: To-Do List, Tabs, Stopwatch, Modal Popup

### Stage 3 â€“ Local Storage & Data Handling (21â€“30)
- JSON, arrays/objects, CRUD, persistence with `localStorage`
- Examples: Notes App, Expense Tracker, Dark/Light Mode Toggle

### Stage 4 â€“ Working with APIs (31â€“40)
- Fetch API, async/await, real-world data
- Examples: Weather App, Movie Search, GitHub User Finder, Crypto Price Tracker

### Stage 5 â€“ Advanced Concepts & Framework-Prep (41â€“50)
- State management, reusable components, async workflows
- Examples: Kanban Board, Infinite Scroll, E-Commerce Product List, Social Feed App

## âœ… Learning Goals

- Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals (DOM, events, functions, arrays, objects)  
- Practice asynchronous programming with `fetch` and APIs  
- Learn persistence with `localStorage`  
- Get comfortable with **GitHub workflow**: branches, commits, pull requests  
- Prepare for modern frameworks like **Vue** and **React**

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This is a **learning repository**. Each project is intentionally simple and focused on practicing one or more JavaScript concepts.  

Improvements are encouraged as part of the journey: adding features, refactoring, or rewriting with modern patterns (ES6 modules, classes, etc.).
