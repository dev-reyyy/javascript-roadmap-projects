# Simple Calculator

## 📖 Overview

A basic calculator app that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) between two numbers. The result is displayed instantly after clicking the calculate button.

## 🚀 Features

- Input fields for two numbers
- Dropdown to select the arithmetic operation
- Calculates and displays the result on button click
- Clean and user-friendly interface

## 🛠️ Tech/Concepts Practiced

- DOM selection and manipulation
- Event listeners (`click` event)
- Handling form inputs and validation
- Arithmetic operations in JavaScript
- Using object lookup for operation logic

## 📚 Learning Notes

- **Initial Approach:**
  - I first used a `switch` statement to handle the different operations.
- **Improvement:**
  - I learned about using an object lookup to map operation names to functions, which made the code cleaner and easier to extend.
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Allow users to continue calculations with the result, so after getting a result, they can perform another operation using the current result and a new number (like chaining calculations in a real calculator).
