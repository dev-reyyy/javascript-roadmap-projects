# Counter App

## 📖 Overview

A simple counter application that allows users to increment, decrement, or reset a numeric value. The counter value is displayed in an input field and updates in real-time as users interact with the buttons.

## 🚀 Features

- Increment and decrement the counter value using buttons
- Prevents the counter from going below zero
- Reset button to set the counter back to zero
- Counter value is displayed and editable in an input field

## 🛠️ Tech/Concepts Practiced

- DOM selection and manipulation
- Event listeners (`click` events)
- Handling and updating input field values
- Type conversion from string to number using the unary plus (`+`) operator

## 📚 Learning Notes

- **Challenge:**
  - I needed to convert the string value from the input field to a number before performing arithmetic operations, but I forgot the syntax.
- **Solution:**
  - I looked it up and used the unary plus (`+`) operator to convert the string to a number.
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Add an option to increase or decrease the counter by a custom value, not just by 1
